play as a little hour glass who’s time is constantly running out. If the Time hits 0 it’s game over and you restart at the beginning.

Destroying enemies allows you to steal their time and add to your own

You can teleport forward in time to gain ground and to travel through walls (this costs time) You can also rewind time to a snapshot taken every 3 seconds to remedy mistakes.
